- I am _currently_:
  - I blog on www.andreinc.net 
  - Working and looking for help on: [mapneat](https://github.com/nomemory/mapneat), [mockneat](https://github.com/nomemory/mockneat), [serverneat](https://github.com/nomemory/serverneat) and [nml](https://github.com/nomemory/neat-matrix-library);
  - Fluent in Java, C and python;
  - Somewhat fluent in C++;
  - Learning **Kotlin**;
  - Unraveling the mysteries of Microservice Architectures;
  - Studying Linear Algebra for fun, checkout my work so far: [neat-matrix-library](https://github.com/nomemory/neat-matrix-library) . Checkout my articles on this topic: https://www.andreinc.net/categories/#linear-algebra
- :sheep: Fun fact, my family name means Shepperd;
- You can reach me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrei-n-ciobanu-50708611/)**.
